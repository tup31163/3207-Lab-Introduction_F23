# 3207-Lab-Introduction_F23
In this lab, you will be learning about git and some of the features of git and GitHub. A part of the lab will be to clone this repository and and then make changes to the repository.
The attached simple source file print_random.c is to be modified by you to include a function that implements the randchar() function.
See the instructions in the GitHW1a file

## Documentation
print_random.c was given and unchanged. 

## Troubleshooting
### SSH Key
I initially struggled to connect two Github accounts to Git on my computer. I learned that I can create an SSH key for each account, and clone repositories with SSH instead of HTTPS or Github CLI.
